### KeyMap Setting and UTF-8 for my Website
### what I have learned:

유니코드(Unicode)는 전 세계의 있는 모든 문자를 컴퓨터에서 사용할 수 있도록 표현 하는 것이다. 
UTF-8 은 Universal Coded Character Set + Transformation Format – 8-bit 의 약자이고
유니코드는 컴퓨터가 이해할 수 있는 형태인 2진수 (예시: 00100)와 같은 형태로 인코딩(encoding) 해서 한 글자당 1바이트에서 최대 4바이트까지 저장 가능하다

UNICODE is a unique number for character of every language to use on any devices, applications and platforms.<br>
UTF-8 (Universal Coded Character Set + Transformation Format – 8-bit) represents Unicode text in web pages<br>
and encodes Unicode to binary form (ex: 00100) which computer can understand and one character can be store in maximum 4 bytes.
