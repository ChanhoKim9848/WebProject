The reason why Spring Tool Suite4 will be used <br>
JetBrains company is a software development one to make a tool for developers<br>
such as IntelliJ (Java,Spring and apps), Android Studio and Kotlin (Android Language) but is not free <br>
so we will use free version of Spring tool called Spring Tool Suite4 <br>

### KeyMap Setting and UTF-8 for my Website <br>
### what I have learned: <br>
UTF-8 (Universal Coded Character Set + Transformation Format – 8-bit) <br>
<br> UTF-8 is an encoding system for Unicode. It can translate any Unicode character to a matching unique binary string,
<br> and can also translate the binary string back to a Unicode character
<br> Unicode alone doesn’t store words in binary. Computers need a way to translate
